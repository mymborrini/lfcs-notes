Create and Boot a VM

When we download an image, for example: ubuntu-24.04.img

We can use qemu to check the image info


$ qemu-img info ubuntu-24.04.img
...
virtual size: 3.5 GiB
...

In order to change the size (since we want to install something on our operative system)

$ qemu-img resize ubuntu-24.04.img 10G

Now our virtualization tools will need to access what's called a storage pool. In this pool it will store disk images, snapshots, and other data.
The default location: /var/lib/libvirt/

$ ls /var/lib/libvirt/
* boot dnsmasq images qemu sanlock

So we can simply copy the image in the right folder:
$ sudo cp ubuntu-24.04.img /var/lib/libvirt/images/

$ virt-install --osinfo list
...
ubunut24.04, ubuntunoble
...


$ virt-install \
 --import \


To understand each command press
$ man virt-install

and then press ? <the command, import for example> and then press enter until the command is found.

For example import tells our utility to skip the OS installation process, that's because normally virt-install will try to install an operating system on top of a disk image
That's because our disk image already has the ubuntu operating system pre-installed


Of course another way to see the most common used options is to

$ virt-install --help

So in the end

$ virt-install --osinfo ubunut24.04 --name ubuntu1 --memory 1024 --vcpus 1 --import --disk /var/lib/libvirt/ubunut24.04.img --graphics none
...
Escaper character is ^] (Ctrl + ])
...

In the end it will ask us to login, since we didn't set a username or a passowrd we can exit from the vm console.

We can press (Ctrl + ]) (in this case), and exist the console. So the creation and the booting of the vm works fine.


We cannot login since we don't know the root Password

$ virsh list --all
*   Id      name        State
* ---------------------------
*   1       ubuntu1     running

Now shut it down

$ virsh shutdown ubuntu1

We can use the old command but we can add some options at the end

$ virt-install --osinfo ubunut24.04 --name ubuntu1 --memory 1024 --vcpus 1 --import --disk /var/lib/libvirt/ubunut24.04.img --graphics none --cloud-init \
    root-password-generate=on

The random root password will be displayed for 10 seconds. So we should be ready to copy it. Then the installation is starting and

ubunutu login: root
Password: <the passowrd you copied before>

After a couple of more steps you can login in

$ root@ubuntu

Inside the vm you can check how the vm is separated

$ df -h
Filesystem      size    used    Avail       use     Mounted on
/dev/root/      8.7G    466M    8.2G        6%      /
tmpfs           481M       0    481M        0%      /dev/shm
...

If we try a simple

$ apt update
....
...

We don't have a particular problem, that's beacusa virsh provides us a lot of based configuration, network connectivity included

WIth
$ logout

$ ctrl + ]

We will detach from the vm:

To attach to the vm console again:

$ virsh console ubuntu1
