Installing OS on VM

A different scenario from lesson number 2 is when we want to install an OS on a booting VM

So in this case we create a VM

Create a VM ( vcpus etc ) --> Attach a Virtual CD RAM/ DVD RAM ---> Create an empty Disk image ---> Install an operating system on top of it

$ virt-install --osinfo debian12 --name debian1 --memory 1024 --vcpus 1 --disk size=10 --location /var/lib/libvirt/boot/debian12-netinst.iso --graphics none
    --extra-args "console=ttyS0"

--extra-args "console=ttyS0" in this case in essence it gives us a way to connect to that virtual machine and interact with it in a text only environment.

Without this option it would boot in such a way that we'd have no way to connect to the console without aa graphical user interface available on the system.

We don't run this command since we don't have a Debiano 12 installation ISO available, and we don't want to download a new one because we have a more efficient
way to make this done.

We can tell virsh to download the only files that needs for the installation without the whole image, and this will reduce the time for the image to be installed.


The command is the same but we change the location from a local location to an internet location

$ virt-install --osinfo debian12 --name debian1 --memory 1024 --vcpus 1 --disk size=10 --location https://deb.debian.org/debian/dists/bookworm/main/installer-amd64/ --graphics none
    --extra-args "console=ttyS0"

Then the procedure is more or less the same.

At the end instead of opening a console, there will be a blue screen which is an output from the Linux kernel, we're greeted by the installer.

We select the language and the keymap layout and press enter.

With Ctrl + ] we can detach in any moment.
