Create and enforce MAC using SELinux

How we can enforce mandatory access control (MAC) with the help of Linux security.  Red Hat and CentOs operating systems have SELinux enabled by default but Ubuntu has a different security module called apparmor,
which is used by default. 

So what if we want to use SELinux on Ubuntu?
Since apparmor is enabled by default

$ sudo systemctl stop apparmor service
$ sudo systemctl disable apparmor service


Next we have to installed two packages 

$ sudo apt install selinux-basics auditd

auditd will help us customize SELinux for our system

To check if SELinux is enabled on our system we can run

$ sestatus
# SELinux status: 	disabled

As expected, since we just installed modules is disabled in our case. First, the boot loader needs to be configured to tell the Linux kernel to load the security module. Also every file on the system needs to be properly labeled because SELinux uses labels for everything to decide what a certain object is allowed to do. 

$ ls -Z

? bin
? boot
? dev
...

The question marks appear instead of proper security labels. Ubuntu has a utility that can go through all the steps necessary to enable SELinux
