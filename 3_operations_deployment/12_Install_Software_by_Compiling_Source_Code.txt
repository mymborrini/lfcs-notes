Install Software by Compiling Source Code


We saw how to install software from Ubuntu's repositories as well as third-party repositories.

But in some cases will simply have to download the code from a place like github and compile it ourselves. Convert it from human readable text code to executable code for computers that can run efficiently.

For example

$ git clone https://github.com/htop-dev/htop.git


Now check for different instructions
$ less Readme.md

After reading the Readme we have to install the packages

$ sudo apt install libncursesw5-dev autotools-dev autoconf automake build-essentials


The build-essentials package is almost always needed as it pulls in most of the compilation tools that we require.

Every shell in Linux is configured to look for application in /usr/local/bin/ directory
