Access Control Lists (ACLs) and Attributes


Image we have a situation like this

-rw-rw-r--     alex staff   file1
-rw-rw-r--     alex staff   file2
-rw-rw-r--     alex staff   file3


We want jeremy who does not belong to stuff group to be able to write only on file3

We will use ACL.

First install it, if they are not already install it.

$ sudo apt install acl

(setfacl stands for set file access control list )
$ sudo setfacl --modify user:jeremy:rw file3

If we want to add all permissions

$ sudo setfacl --modify user:jeremy:rwx file3

if now we look at the file permissions

-rw-rw-r--     alex staff   file1
-rw-rw-r--     alex staff   file2
-rw-rw-r--+     alex staff   file3


As you can see to indicate that file3 has some ACL stuff included there is a + sign near the permissions. TO see the ACL for this file we can use

$ getfacl file3
# file: file3
# owner: alex
# group: staff
user::rw-
user:jeremy:rw-
group::rw-
mask::rw-
other::r--

The mask defines the maximum permission that this file cor directory can have. Sometimes a mask could be useful if we want to limit exsisting
permission. For example we want that nobody can write or execute that file

$ sudo setfacl --modify mask:r file3

$ getfacl file3
# file: file3
# owner: alex
# group: staff
user::rw-
user:jeremy:rw-         #effective:r--
group::rw-              #effective:r--
mask::r--
other::r--

The effective part shows us that the mask limits the permissions here.

Now let's see groups:

To let anyone in the sudo group read and write to this file, we add this command:

$ sudo setfacl --modify group:sudo:rw


To deny all permissions for a specific user, we just specify the username followed by an empty list of permissions bit (3 '-')


$ sudo setfacl --modify user:jeremy:--- file3


We can remove acl for a user with this command

$ sudo setfacl --remove user:jeremy file3

or for the sudo group

$ sudo setfacl --remove group:sudo file3

To remove all acl entries we can use this command

$ sudo setfacl --remove-all file3


To apply a change to all directories and subdirectories (recursively)

$ sudo setfacl --recursive -m user:jeremy:rwx dir1/

The same to remove

$ sudo setfacl --recursive --remove user:jeremy dir1/


Now let's create a new file and enable the 'append only' attribute

$ echo "This is old content" >  newfile

$ sudo chattr +a newfile

With this attribute we can only append, so set new data on top of old data. We can just keep adding but we cannot override or change old data.

To remove append only from a file we can just do something like this:

$ sudo chattr -a newfile


Now let's talk about the immutable attribute (i)

$ sudo chattr +i newfile

Now nobody can modify or delete this file.

To check the attribute of a file

$ lsattr newfile
----i---------e------- newfile

As ls it can work for an entire directory

$ lsattr
----i---------e------- newfile
--------------e------- file1
--------------e------- file2
--------------e------- file3

To remove the attirbute is the same

$ sudo chattr -i newfile


Other attributes can be seen in the user manual

$ man chattr
