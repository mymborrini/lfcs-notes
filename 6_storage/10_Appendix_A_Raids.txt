RAID (Reduntant Array of Independent Disks)

In Raid setup the data is copied on multiple disks. So that in the event of a Disk failure the data can be saved.

THere are 4 types of RAID
- RAID 0
- RAID 1
- RAID 5
- RAID 10

RAID 0 is not fault tolerant. RAID 0 should not even called RAID, it does not prevent data-tolerance. It increases the chances of data loss. 
The data is not duplicatedc but is actually spread over 2 disks. So if one of these 2 disks failed, all the data will be lost. The only reason why
you would like to use raid 0 is that accessing data is much faster. 

RAID 1 is fault tolerant. In RAID 1 set up the data is copied on more than one disk. So disk2 will have the same copy of the data as disk1.

RAID 5. In order to use RAID 5 you need to have 3 or more disks. Is fast and it can stores a large amount of data.
In RAID 5 the data is spread across 2 disks and in the 3rd disk is saved an information called parity. Parity is used to rebuild data in case 
of disk failure.
The downside of disk 5 is that since the equivalent of an entire disk is used to store parity, it reduce the collective amount of data that can be stored
in this Array. 
An Array of 4 disks with 1 terabity each, only 3 terabytes will be used. Because the equivalent of one entire disk will be used to store parity.

RAID 10 is what the name said it combines RAID 1 and RAID 0 togheter. You need to have at least 4 disk. 
The 4 disks are divided in set of 2. A raid 0 is used before these 2 sets and a raid 1 is used in each of this 2 sets. So the information is spread
amongs the set and every piece of information is duplicated among 2 disk.
So RAID 10 benefits for the fault tolerance of RAID 1 and the speed of RAID 0. 
The downside is that you can use only 50% of the capacity for data storage. So if you use 4 disks you can only use 2 of them for actual storage. 


USE mdadm TO CREATE RAID

We have the following situation
$ lsblk
NAME             TYPE    MOUNTPOINT
sda              disk  
|_sda1           part    [SWAP]
|_sda2           part    /var/log
|_sda3           part    /home
sdb              disk
sdc              disk 
sdd              disk
sde              disk     
sdf              disk 
sr0              rom                

Then we use 

$ fdisk <device-name>

to create different partitions

$ lsblk
NAME             TYPE    MOUNTPOINT
sda              disk  
|_sda1           part    [SWAP]
|_sda2           part    /var/log
|_sda3           part    /home
sdb              disk
|_sdb1           part
sdc              disk
|_sdc1           part 
sdd              disk
|_sdd1           part
sde              disk\
|_sde1           part     
sdf              disk
|_sdf1           part 
sr0              rom 

Now we can create a raid of level 5
$ mdadm --create --level 5 --raid-device 5 /dev/md0 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1 /dev/sdd1 /dev/sde1 /dev/sdf1 --spare-devices=0

/dev/md0 raid is this device go through. 
mdam --detail --scan > /etc/mdadm.conf 

To check if everything is properly settled.

$ lsblk
NAME             TYPE    MOUNTPOINT
sda              disk  
|_sda1           part    [SWAP]
|_sda2           part    /var/log
|_sda3           part    /home
sdb              disk
|_sdb1           part
  |_md0          raid5
sdc              disk
|_sdc1           part 
  |_md0          raid5
sdd              disk
|_sdd1           part
  |_md0          raid5
sde              disk
|_sde1           part
  |_md0          raid5     
sdf              disk
|_sdf1           part 
  |_md0          raid5
sr0              rom 

You see that everything is now connected through md0 into a RAID.

Now let's test it:
$ mkdir -p /mnt/raid1

Now we have to create the fileSystem because right now we create the raid but not the filesystem upon it

$ mkfs.ext4 /dev/md0

And not mount it

$ mount /dev/md0 /mnt/raid1

Save it in the /etc/fstab so it can be mounted during reboot and make it persistent. 

...
/dev/mod0 /mnt/raid1 ext4 defaults 0 0
