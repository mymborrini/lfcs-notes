Working With Files and Directories


LIST:

What is a file system tree? What is an absolute path and what is a relative path? 

We use the 
\
$ ls, 
To list the files and the directories in the current directory. In Linux you can have files or directories which start with a dot '.'. They won't be displayed by a simple ls command they are hidden.

$ ls -a 

Display these files and directories ( -a stays from all)

If you type 

$ ls -l
* drwxr-xr-x. 	2	root	root	4096	Oct 18	22:52	anaconda
* -rw-rw----.	1	root	utmp	0	Jun 24	09:21	chrony

Let's analyze the first line:

drwxr-xr-x. => is the permission from file or directory
root	root => is the user and the group owns each entry
Oct 18	22:52 => The last modified


We can combine -a and -l

$ ls -la

We even have the option of a human readable format (h)

$ ls -alh



Linux organize the files and directories in a Filesystem Tree:

  			/
  ---------------------------------------		
  |					|
home					var
|  |------------			|
|	 	|			log
aaron		jane
|
Documents
|
Invoice.pdf

Like a tree we also have root (/), branches, leaf.

/ is the top level directory and no other directories can be above this one. Under this directoriy, there are a lot of more directories like home,var,etc and so on.. Under each one of these subdirectories there are other subdirectories like log.


If you take for example Invoice.pdf we have  a file path and a directory path: each of them can be expressed in a different way
The absolute path and the relative path

ABSOLUTE PATH
FILE PATH: /home/aaron/documents/Invoice.pdf
DIRECTORY PATH: /home/aaron/documents/


The command

$ pwd

Will Print Working Directory.

To change the current directory we can use the cd command.

$ cd <path>

The path could be the absolute path or the relative path. 

$ cd .. => parent directory 

The cd .. could be used multiple type cd ../..

There are other useful commands:

$ cd / 		# Go to the root directory
$ cd -		# Go to the previous directory
$ cd		# Go to your home directory




CREATING

We want to create new file in the current directory

$ touch Receipt.pdf

As always uf you want to create it to another location

$ touch /home/jane/Receipt.pdf


If we want to create a new directory

$ mkdir 			# will create new directory



COPYING

$ cp [source] [destination] 	# Will copy a file from a source to a destination

For example:
$ cp Receipt.pdf	Receipts/			# This will copy the Receipt.pdf file in the Receipts directory
$ cp Receipt.pdf	Receipts/ReceiptCopy.pdf	# This will copy the Receipt.pdf file in the Receipts directory and change its name

To copy a directories 
$ cp -r [source] [destination]	# -r stays from recursive

For example:
$ cp -r Receipts/	BackupOfReceips/	# This will copy all the files from the Receipts folder to the BackupOfReceipts folder.

N.B. The destination directories MUST NOT exist in the target system

If BackupOfReceips already exists, a new folder named Receipts will be created under BackupOfReceipts so somethinfg like this


BackupOfReceips/Receipts/<all the files>.



MOVING

$ mv [source] [dest]


For example

mv Receipts.pdf Receips/
Will move the Receipts file under the Receipts folder.


To rename a file of a directory use the new name as the destination



DELETE

To remove a file or a directory

$ rm <file-name>

Like always 

$ rm -r <directory-name>
