Linux give you a lot of way to access documentation about each command:

For example:

$ ls --help


will show you every options of using ls , which is a very simple command

Another more complex command is journalctl which is the command used to read operating system logs (very useful) 

$ journalctl --help
* journalctl [OPTIOSN...] [MATCHES...]
* ....
* lines 1-27

At the bottom of the help screen you will see that the help page is paginated. So you can use

Arrow up '^', Arrow down 'v', Page Up, Page down to move through the lines. 
At the end you can type 'q' to exit from the help.

All the main command in linux have their own manual in pages

To access the manual you can type

$ man <command-name>

For exampple

$ man journalctl

will show the manual for this command with the synopsis (aka the way the command is used)
* journalctl [OPTIOSN...] [MATCHES...]

And a description about the command does. And some examples sometimes.

Sometimes like the command printf, the command can mean different things. Printf fior example can be a command but also a function that can be used in bash programs. 
Manual pages can belgong into one of this categories or section and we can see this by looking at the manual pages for the man command

$ man man

* The table blow shows the section numbers of the manual followed by the types of pages they contain.
*
* 1 Executable programs or shell commands
* 2 System calls (functionsprovided by the kernel)
* 3 Library calls (function within program libraries)
* 4 Special files (usually found in /dev)
* 5 File formats anc conventions eg /etc/passwd
* 6 Games
* 7 Miscellaeous (including macro packages and conventions), e.g. man (7), groff(7)
* 8 System administration commands (usually only for root)
* 9 Kernel routines [Non standard]

You tell man you wnat the print f for section 1 like this

$ man 1 printf

If you want the function

$ man 3 printf


Now image you forget the name of a command, for example the command for creating a new directory.

apropos is a command which check in the description of all the manual pages and look for the word you inserted. In the example before

$ apropos director

N.B. We choose director and not directory because director will match both directory and directories

The first time we ran apropos an error appears

$ apropos director
* director: nothing appropriate

If we just started the VM the database where apropos is looking at is not been created yet, because the manual pages still need to be indexed.   

We can create it manually by typing

$ sudo mandb

(In general this should be done automatically and there is no need to do such a thing)                                                                                                             


$ apropos director
* ...
* mkdir (1) - make directories
* mkdir (2) - make directories
* ...

Apropos just not simply list commands, but it looks for a lot of descriptions functions ecc... so the number isnide the paranthessis represents those sections .
In the example before since commands are in section 1 and 8 we must search in this two sections

We can do it by using the '-s' optiosn


$ apropos -s 1,8 director

THis will filter the sections only for 1 and 8



AUTOCOMPLETIONS

Another thing that will save you a lot of time is autocompletion

TO use it (for example the command systemctl) you can press 
$ 'systemc' and then p[ress TAB to complete your word


ANother way to use TAB is for a suggestion of command you can use, for example

$ systemctl <SPACE> and the press double time TAB TAB

And a lot of list of commands will display to help you complete the command you want


Let's choose
$ systemctl list-dependencies 

Tab for suggestion and autocompletiosn helps you even in completing tab and filenames

To sell all files and directories press TAB three times.
