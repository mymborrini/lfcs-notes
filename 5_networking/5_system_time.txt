Set and Synchronize System Time using Time Servers

Hardware clocks and computers are not perfect. They slowly drift away from the real time.

So they periodically get the exact time from the internet, and they get it from what are called time servers, more specifically NTP (Network time protocol)
servers.

In ubuntu there is a systemd utility named:

systemd-timesyncd

Firstable we want to set a server to a specific time-zone:

To see all specific timezones:
$ timedatectl list-timezones

TO set a timezones

$ sudo timedatectl set-timezone <Timezone>

To check our current timezone

$ timedatectl
Local time:
Universal time:
RTC time:
Time zone:
System clock synchronized:
NTP service
RTC in local TZ

If the NTP service is not set to active:

1 Install the utility
$ sudo apt install systemd-timesyncd

2 Set ntp to true
$ sudo timedatectl set-ntp true

We can check the status of timesync

$ systemctl status systemd-timesyncd.service

Here we can customize a lot of stuff, maybe the ntp server/s we want to connect.
$ sudo vim /etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf

Then:
$ sudo systemctl restart systemd-timesyncd

To see if our changes has been applied accordingly we can see all the different options we have:

$ timedatectl <tab> <tab>

For example:
$ timedatectl show-timesync

Or:
$ timedatectl timesync-status

To set the ntp pools servers: in /etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf

NTP=0.asia.pool.ntp.org 1.asia.pool.ntp.org 2.asia.pool.ntp.org 3.asia.pool.ntp.org
