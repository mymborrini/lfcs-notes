Configure Linux to use LDAP:

Linux keeps user account and information stored locally so for example:

$ cat /etc/passwd

user1:.... a lot of imformation


A possible task:

The node01 was configured to use LDAP entries from a certain server. However, some configuration options are wrong. 
Edit the correct configuration files and fix the following mistakes:

Our name service local daemon is configured to look for an LDAP server at the wrong IP address (currently 10.9.9.8).
 Fix this and configure the correct IP which is: 192.168.121.167. Make sure your changes become active after you edit the configuration file.

Our system is currently configured to get group data and password data from the LDAP server but not user data. 
Configure it to get user data as well.
