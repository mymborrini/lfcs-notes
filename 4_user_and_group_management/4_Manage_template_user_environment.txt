We know that when we create a user all files from

/etc/skel 


Examples:
Image we want to inform all new users about some default policy:

We can create a file like the following:

$ sudo vim /etc/skel/README
# Please don't run CPU-intensive processes between 8AM and 10PM


So a new user can find a README in their home directory and using a command like cat they can see our message. 

If we want the user to use a special command we can change the PATH variable by adding a semicolon and adding a new location  for example /opt/bin

.bashrc
....

PATH="/opt/bin:$PATH"

When we type a command like 'ls' for example linux will look for this command in the PATHS directory ( each path is separated by a semicolon ) and if it find one it can execute it. This is useful so a user can avoid writing down the whole abosulute path for a specific command. 


If you want to add the same variable path for each user instead of Setting it for the whole System, just change the variable in /etc/skel/.bashrc
