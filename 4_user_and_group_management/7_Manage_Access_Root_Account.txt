Manage Access to Root Account

To login as root, for user with sudo priviledges

$ sudo --login === sudo -i

To exit

$ logout

If the user has not sudo priviledges but knows root password it can use

$ su - === su -l === su --login

If a user has a root user locked it does not mean that we can't use the root user but we can't do a regular login with a password. 

So this is ok

$ sudo --login

And this is not ok

$ su -



If we wanto to allow people to log in as root with a password, we have two options

We can set a new password

$ sudo passwd root

or we can unlock it if it was unlocked in the past

$ sudo passwd --unlock root === sudo passwd -u root

Then we can use

$ su -

And type the password to log in

To lock root account

$ sudo passwd --lock root === sudo passwd -l root

Make sure to only lock rqoot if your user can use sudo commands. With no root login and no sudo you find yourseld in the situation of not being able to become root at all, effectively locking yourself.

To switch to a user and execute a command

$ su - mary -c 'find /home/mary/ -type d -empty -delete'
